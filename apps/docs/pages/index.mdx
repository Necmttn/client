# Aigur Client

### What is Aigur Client?

A free and opensource (MIT) client to compose and invoke fully typed Generative AI pipelines.

<Callout>
  Aigur Client is supported by [Aigur](https://aigur.dev) but can be used entirely independent of
  Aigur.

### A Simple Example

This is a simple example of a pipeline that takes a subject and returns a joke about that subject.

Btw, everything is fully typed! ðŸŽ‰

  ## Instantiate the Client

After installing the `@aigur/client` npm package, import the `createClient` function and instantiate the client.

```ts index.ts focus=1,3
import { createClient } from '@aigur/client';

export const aigur = createClient();



























//
```

## Define Your API Keys

Pipelines use different services to generate your desired output. Define your API keys for those services in the `apiKeys` property.
It is typed for specific services (OpenAI, Stability, Google etc) but you can add additional custom keys as well.

It is recommended to instantiate the Aigur Client on the server side as to not leak your API keys to the client but it's not mandatory.

Since we're using the OpenAI GPT-3 service in our example, we'll add our API key for that.

```ts index.ts focus=4:6
import { createClient } from '@aigur/client';

export const aigur = createClient({
  apiKeys: {
    openai: process.env.OPENAI_KEY!,
  },
});
```

--- 
## Create a New Pipeline

We'll create a new pipeline that will hold our logic. Let's name it `jokegpt`.

```ts index.ts focus=9:12
import { createClient } from '@aigur/client';

export const aigur = createClient({
  apiKeys: {
    openai: process.env.OPENAI_KEY!,
  },
});

export const jokeGptPipeline = aigur.pipeline
  .create({
    id: 'jokegpt',
  });
```

--- 
## Input/Output

Pipelines have input and output that are defined using [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).
Input and Output must be of type `z.object`.

```ts index.ts focus=2,13:18
import { createClient } from '@aigur/client';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const aigur = createClient({
  apiKeys: {
    openai: process.env.OPENAI_KEY!,
  },
});

export const jokeGptPipeline = 
  aigur.pipeline.create({
    id: 'jokegpt',
    input: z.object({
      subject: z.string(),
    }),
    output: z.object({
      text: z.string(),
    })
  });
```

--- 
## Go with the Flow

Now that we know what our pipeline accepts and returns, we need to define the flow of the pipeline itself.
The flow is comprised of `nodes` that are chained together.
Each node also has an input and an output, where the output of one node is the input of the next node.

We can access our different nodes using the `flow` builder, where they are organized by namespaces according to their type.

When we define a node (`flow.text.modify.simple` for example), we need to define its input which is fully typed. We can enter hardcoded values in the input's properties or access previous nodes or the pipeline's input parameters.

In our first node, `flow.text.modify.simple`, which accepts `text` and `modifier` as input, we'll use the `input` parameter to access the pipeline's input and reference the `subject` property. This node takes our `subject` and adds the text "tell me a joke about" before it

Next, we'll call OpenAI's GPT3 and pass the modified text as the prompt. Since we don't have any more nodes in our pipeline, the output of this node will be the output of the pipeline itself.

```ts index.ts focus=18:27
import { createClient } from '@aigur/client';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const aigur = createClient({
  apiKeys: {
    openai: process.env.OPENAI_KEY!,
  },
});

export const jokeGptPipeline = 
  aigur.pipeline.create({
    id: 'jokegpt',
    input: z.object({
      subject: z.string(),
    }),
    output: z.object({
      text: z.string(),
    }),
    flow: (flow) =>
      flow.text.modify
        .simple(({ input }) => ({
          text: input.subject,
          modifier: 'tell me a joke about $(text)$',
        }))
        .text.prediction.gpt3(({ prev }) => ({
          prompt: prev.text,
        })),
  });
```

--- 
## Invoke it!
All that's left is to execute our pipeline. We can do that by calling the `invoke` method on the pipeline and passing the input parameters.

The output `text` is typed by the pipeline's `output` property.

```ts index.ts focus=30:32
import { createClient } from '@aigur/client';
import { z } from 'zod';

export const aigur = createClient({
  apiKeys: {
    openai: process.env.OPENAI_KEY!,
  },
});

export const jokeGptPipeline = 
  aigur.pipeline.create({
    id: 'jokegpt',
    input: z.object({
      subject: z.string(),
    }),
    output: z.object({
      text: z.string(),
    }),
    flow: (flow) =>
      flow.text.modify
        .simple(({ input }) => ({
          text: input.subject,
          modifier: 'tell me a joke about $(text)$',
        }))
        .text.prediction.gpt3(({ prev }) => ({
          prompt: prev.text,
        })),
  });

const { text } = await jokeGptPipeline.invoke({
  subject: 'a car'
});
```
