### What is Aigur Client?

A free and opensource (MIT) client to compose and invoke fully typed Generative AI pipelines.

# Examples

## Create an Image with your Voice

This pipeline takes an audio recording of a prompt, transcribes it using Whisper, enhances it with keywords using GPT3 and generates an image using Stable Diffusion.

<VoiceToImage />

## Image to Poem

<ImageToPoem />




Next, we'll learn about value referencing, remote invocations, streaming results and dynamic pipeline endpoint creation.
