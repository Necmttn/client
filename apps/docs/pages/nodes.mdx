The Pipeline Node definitions are organized in a tree structure by their respective functionality, for example:

- `flow.text.modify.simple` - modifies a text
- `flow.text.prediction.gpt3` - calls gpt3 to predict a text
- `flow.image.textToImage.stability` - calls Stability (Stable Diffusion) to create an image from a text

The tree structure in the API is mirrored in the docs.

More Nodes are being added all the time, so check back often!
