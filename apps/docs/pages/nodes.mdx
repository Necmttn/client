Pipelines are composed of Nodes which are simple functions.

The `@aigur/client` package comes with a set of predefined Nodes, which can be used to create Pipelines.
More Nodes are being added all the time, so check back often!

[Contribute](https://github.com/weareaigur/client) to `@aigur/client` or [create your own Nodes](/customnodes) and share them with the community!
